# Power-BI-project-using-python-Dashboards-
🔧 Project Idea: Customer Sales Forecasting Dashboard
✅ Objectives:
Analyze sales data.

Forecast future sales using a time series model (like ARIMA or Prophet).

Visualize results in Power BI using Python scripting.

📁 1. Data Preparation
Use a dataset (e.g., CSV or Excel) with fields like:

Date

Customer

Product

Sales

You can use a dummy dataset or real data from your business.

🐍 2. Python Script for Forecasting
Write a script to:

Load and clean the data.

Perform time series forecasting.

Output forecasted values as a DataFrame for Power BI.
📊 3. Using Python in Power BI
🧩 Enable Python scripting:
Go to File > Options > Python scripting in Power BI Desktop.

Point to your local Python installation (Anaconda or standard).

📉 Add a Python visual:
Click Python Visual in the Visualizations pane.

Drag your data fields into the Values section.

Power BI will pass the data to your Python script.

Paste your Python script (like the one above) into the editor.
🧠 4. Add More Features (Optional)
Machine learning: Use scikit-learn for customer segmentation or churn prediction.

Data cleaning: Use Pandas to preprocess data before visualization.

Matplotlib/seaborn plots: Add custom charts that Power BI can't create natively.
